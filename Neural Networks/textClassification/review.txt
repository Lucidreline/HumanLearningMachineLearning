If I had to characterize Breaking Bad in comparison to other high-quality TV shows, I would call it "the show that never did anything wrong". BrBa has a flawless storyarc, which neatly connects the first episode of season 1 with the final episode of season 5. The ending of the series, which has often been the weak point of many other great shows, feels almost inevitable - as many great endings in literature also do.
